# KinectOnlineActionDetection
------------------------------
We implemented an online action detection program that is able to take a stream of live frames from Microsoft Kinect (V1) and detect the actions being performed in an online manner. The training on the dataset is done in a different program and the training results are suplied to this project to make the online detection.
We used "MSR Action3D Dataset" in the training phase. So, the program can detect only actions provided in this dataset.
